# libft

Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

42 makes us do this so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.

My libft currently contains:

* Generic Linked List Functions
* Functions for String Manipulation
* Functions for Memmory Manipulation
* Generic Function Pointer Functions
* Simple Functions on Standard Output
* Functions to Output to File Descriptors
* Simple Generic Functions I Added
* A Function to Return 1 Line From a File Descriptor
